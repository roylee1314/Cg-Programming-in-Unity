What can we use culling for? 
One application is to use a different shader for the front faces than for the back faces,i.e. for the outside and the inside of an object.

Here is my understanding:
Cull is totally different with 'discard'
'Cull Front': the back faces are rendered with the shader1. 
'Cull Back' : the front faces are rendered with the shader2.
So we can use different shaders for the front faces than for the back faces
